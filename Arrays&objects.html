        // The primitive data types are as follows-

        let myVar = 34;
        let myVar2 = "string";
        let myVar3 = true;
        let myVar4 = null;
        let myVar5 = undefined;

        // Apart from primitive data types, all the other are objects. Let us now see how to define objects. If we write as follows-
        let employee = {
            name :"Priyanka",
            Surname :"Saini",
            Desination: "Going to be Full Stack Web Developer",
            PLanguage :"Python"
        }
        // console.log(employee);
        // above is an example, where we create objects manually by us. 
        // There is a special kind of object known as Arrays. The JavaScript Array class is a global object that is used in the construction of arrays; which are high level, list-like objects. An array is a special variable, which can hold more than one value at a time. 

        // let names = [1,2,5.4,"Pria","Krishna",undefined];
        // console.log(names[1]);
        // console.log(names);
        // let names = new Array(24);   //this will create an empty array of size 24
        // let names = new Array(23,4,"Kanha","Kanhaiya");
        // console.log(names);
        // console.log(names.length);
        numbers = new Array(5,4,3,2,1);
        numbers = numbers.sort();
        console.log(numbers);
